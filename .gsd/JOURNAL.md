## 2026-01-21: Project Initialization

### Session Summary
- Ran `/new-project` workflow
- Completed deep questioning phase with user
- Researched Clover Labs (website, thesis) to understand target integration
- Created project specification and roadmap

### Key Decisions
- OpenRouter for LLM access (flexibility across providers)
- Focus on data collection + analysis engine for MVP (frontend can iterate)
- Build NER from scratch (fine-tune existing models)
- Vercel for hosting

### Context Gathered
- Clover builds "AI agents that solve distribution"
- Current product: 1Price (dynamic pricing agent)
- This dashboard would be a new "leaf" — AI visibility/distribution monitoring
- User wants this as portfolio piece for Clover application
- Timeline: ASAP but no corners cut

### Next Session
- Run `/plan 1` to detail Phase 1 implementation
- Begin foundation setup
